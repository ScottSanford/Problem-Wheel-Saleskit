Guided Selling,"Sales reps are given interactive tools to demonstrate a product on the spot during a meeting. Through a series of questions and topics, the sales rep can navigate through a wide variety of options based on the needs of that individual customer. Effectively uncovering the appropriate solutions for a customer by accomplishing the discovery phase of the sales journey in a dynamic and flexible way.","Selling an enterprise software solution to a large tech company, a rep can walk a very fine line between impressing the buyer and displaying incompetence. The biggest drivers for tech companies are time, security, and cost reduction. These buyers will see right through a software pitch that lists out features without showing how the product actually helps them increase profitability.","The software sales team implemented SalesKit to harness its Interactive Tools. Rather than display a slideshow of high level jargon, the seller can pull up videos, ROI calculators, and touch-based dynamic graphs that demonstrate how the software will work in the context of the tech company. As questions arise concerning the limitations of the software, SalesKit already has the answers built into the demo.","Using SalesKit in a Guided Selling approach saves the buyer time, responds to pushback related to security and limitations with relevant content, and helps frame the software solution in the context of the tech company where profitability sees large increases.",images/Road.jpg
Scenario Selling,"“If X, then Y.” This is a complex sales process and a substantial support structure is necessary to sustain this scenario. Marketing and product teams must create content that addresses these various scenarios.","A global enterprise procurement center recently acquired another large organization, bringing its active field reps from 300 to 3000. The parent company needed a way to onboard thousands of new representatives related to their way of selling their product in a very short period of time.","Rather than try to build a custom training platform in-house, the procurement firm chose to take advantage of SalesKit so they could quickly and easily distribute enterprise content as well as training material  to thousands of seasoned and new employees. This lets them focus on the content itself. Once the content is approved, it’s easy to push out exactly what the new reps see as they become acclimated to working for the newly acquired organization.","Using SalesKit to onboard a massive salesforce reduced training time from six months to three weeks, making the acquisition seamless and accelerating the rate in which reps enter the field ready to sell.",images/BusinessDocuments.jpg
Complex Segmented Selling,"Each segment of a company acts as a separate entity, making the preparation for a sales meeting long and cumbersome. The frustration of finding the right content for the individual prospect can elongate the sales cycle.","In preparing a sales pitch to a massive CPG organization, sometimes the biggest challenge is knowing who to approach with the pitch. John needed to perform months of research and have conversations with fifty different employees in several smaller segments at the company before attempting to escalate to an executive with buying power. Understanding the complex organizational structure, as well as internal politics in the smaller segments is only scratching the surface of selling to the CPG organization. John needed a smart way to stay organized and tailor his pitch differently, depending on who he was talking to (during a two year sales cycle, no less).","SalesKit allowed John to not only present his pitch to the potential CPG segment (based on very specific buyer needs), but also take notes during his own presentation capturing the buyer’s comments. These notes and contact details are then synced with their CRM to make the intricacies of the organization easy to reference later.","Having SalesKit enabled John to feel comfortable escalating to a senior executive with purchase authority.  John could organize a wide variety of content into a cohesive pitch for this executive, aligning the focus of his meeting with what will help close the deal with this  massive CPG corporation.",images/WomanInField.jpg
Inventory Selling,"The buyer organization has a complex inventory database, and interprets only a small portion of the data (based on very different needs).","Chicago Soda needed a way to improve its distributors’ selling tactics to a major CPG retailer. The retailer had detailed inventory database in place, but the store manager would analyze only a small portion of the data. For distributors to sell smarter, they needed to impress the CPG retailer with its own data and highlight opportunities to increase revenue that were right there in the data.","SalesKit comes with tools that recognize SKUs that consistently do well. Rather than rolling a massive spreadsheet printout on the desk of the retail manager, a distributor can open SalesKit and select only the products that do well on the touchscreen. From there, both seller and buyer can zero in on the SKUs that matter that should be pushed more. In addition to interactive SKU charts, consumer demographics, pallet percentiles, warm/cold storage ratios, and planagrams can all be analyzed within SalesKit for a truly impressive distributor presentation","SKUs that aren’t doing well get phased out, returning focus to SKUs that are doing well and need to be pushed. This results in easy, marginal wins by knowing which products to keep stocked, as well as inventory suggestions for successful product lines.",images/ColoredPencils.jpg
Searchable Selling,Discovery Wizard,"Buyer pushback and questions occur mid-pitch, revealing what is valuable to the buyer. Unfortunately, the content isn’t completely in line with these needs and the presentation gets derailed - fast.","Using the Discovery Wizard interactivity in SalesKit, the sales rep can ask specific screening questions to the buyer and touching the categories that fit. Once four or five categories are selected as buyer needs, the rest of the presentation has been generated specifically for those needs. This way, the seller doesn’t end up flipping back and forth between slides and trying to open a different presentation to look for an answer to a completely off-topic question.","Conversations stay on topic - which should always be about buyer needs and not the limitations of the product being sold. If you’re just getting to know a buyer and want your pitch to floor them, having the content displayed in a matter that caters directly to the audience is a surefire way to get off on the right foot.",images/searchable.jpg
